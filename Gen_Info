Step for Viz2

1. Create a master file with different sheets
2. Use a dataset from Kaggle to have a guide-help.
3. Do a clean and analyze the most important data.
4. Get a date range for programs (1/23/2015-12/27/2022)
5. Create a calendar table starting from Jan/1/2015 to Dec/31/2022 and add index starting from 1 until last day.
6. Create the following tables in excel:
	A: programs (ddate, language, category, rating, class, production, duration)
	B: modes (categories)
	C: languages (languages)
	D: categories (duration)
	E: rating (ratings)
	F: states (state_code, state, region)
	G: users (state_id, created_on, membership, status, subscription, plan, device, payment_method)
7. Using the same dataset from Kaggle of Netflix, divide each information and add them to the tables A-E
8. On the web find the states of US and add them on the table.
9. Search the population of the US and make an imaginary approximate of people who could potentially use Netflix.
10. For table G use the formula ''randombetween'' to fill down the columns
11. When tables are completed, get them as CSV file.
12. On SQL create fake table of each excel table to help you with the BULK INSERT
13. Create the real table on SQL with the proper information (PK, FK, columns, etc)
14. Use BULK INSERT to insert the CSV files to the fake tables.
15. Create stored procedure if necessary to copy the info from the fake table to the real ones.
16. Drop the fake tables when ended
