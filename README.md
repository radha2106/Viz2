# Netflix Dashboard Project
This project is about a dataset/database about how Netflix behaves and produce their insights on revenues, views of programs, amount of users nad their subscription types

## Steps
- First search/find a dataset which use fake netflix information
- Create a helper file where you can add how many series/movies could be programmed in a year
- Find the census of the US and make a mock-up dataset of people who could potentially use netflix
- Since excel has limitiations in rows find a way to create it in pytthon since data will need to be random for a faster procedure
- When files are create in excel, create tables in SQL
- For the 3 most important tables (users, views, programs) you will need to create fake tables to help you better when insert it to the real tables (copy/move)
